## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Absolute positions

### What I learned

I tried to work this thime with absolute positions because we don't need responsive, due to the size of the card.
I could aslo work with a little transition opacity on the :hover effect of the image.
What is very cool with coding is that you always have more than one way to solve a problem.

I don't know what happens with the avatar .png, which display well on my love server preview, and once I've pushed it on github and displayed with live site url, there is a display bug with it. I don't understand why...
